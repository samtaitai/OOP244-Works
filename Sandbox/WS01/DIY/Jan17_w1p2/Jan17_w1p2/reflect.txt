I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops 
and assignments.

1.fscanf
This was a good opportunity to review the usage of fscanf, which I had a chance to utilize one time last semester. I suppose I get a good grip on opening a file and extracting data then saving them into a struct no matter what delimeter is used. I'd like to emphasize that fscanf should read \n when it reads data in the last order for the future me.   

2.sorting algorithm
As well as fscanf, it was good to revisit the algorithm of the bubble sorting which I learned and utilized for the milestone. 

3.decimal point precision
I tried to stick to cin & cout rather than scanf & printf this time, however, I stumbled with the issue that 4.0 was displayed just 4. I was pretty sure that setprecision would work but I feel not comfortable enough to get it work.  

4.the order of #include matters
In the previous semester, the most of console apps that we'd made either wasn't modulized or had a few of header files which made me overlooked the importance of the order of #include. Like the order of function definitions, you can't let it identify anything before #include it. It took me a day to realize it.
