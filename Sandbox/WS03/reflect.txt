Key takeouts from the meeting with the professor:
1. pointer = new type[size] not (), should be [] because it's for size
2. if(m_name != nullptr) means if(m_name) 
3. if resizing follows immediately, pointer doesn't need to be nullptr. 
4. when copying old projects stored in m_projects to temp, and their sizes differ, use for loop. Do not 1:1 assign them. 
4-1. after m_projects became nullptr, it can be assigned by temp 1:1. 
4-2. because 'temp' was declared local scope, it will be freed automatically when the scope ends. 
5. delete[] pointer first, makes it nullptr next.
