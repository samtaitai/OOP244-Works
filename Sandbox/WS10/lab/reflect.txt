At first, I created the validate function by assuming I worked on int type only. Then I changed type that should be changed. For Student and Employee type, there are already >= <= operators for us, it gave me a hint about how it's going to work. 
The tricky part is that copy constructor and copy assignment were prohibited or never provided and we had to work with them. 
In line 35: 

if (!validate(Student(11111), S, 6, v)){

I thought I need copy constructor for the 1st argument cause I'll pass the argument by value, that's the first thing I had in my mind. But I wasn't allowed so I tried to pass the argument as a reference. 
It didn't work out at first but 'const' keyword made it work. To be honest it was pure luck that I found it so I would be very happy to get some explanation about it later.
